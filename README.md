a langeuge based on javascript,assembly and c++
you can use it for anything you want,espically if you dont know how to code                                                                                      

first and foremost the variables used in KS
## Declarations
soilder, takes ONLY numbers,no floating numbers are needed in the kings guard soilders cant fly anyway,for example:
```java
 soilder= 20
```
knight,takes a string value,however every string has to start with a sir AS PART OF THE STRING,for example:
```java
knight= "sir hello world"
using "hello world" will return an error since the string does not starts with sir
knight= sir "hello world" will not work either as it isnt part of the string 
```

horse ,takes boolean either hay or nay and have to decalare it with feed,since the horse wont work without food,example:

```java
Feed horse= true
```
 market,a vairable that allows you to hold more then one value,which can be any type of data stored (string,numbers etc) have to be declared with "buy":
```java
buy market=[1,2,sir fatty,dead king,long live the queen]
```
## Functions
## Import/Export
## Loops
## send pigeon/recive pigeon
fetch is wildly used in JavaScript to recive data from servers or to send ,however we feel like its too modern for our taste
as such we changed it to " send/recive pigeon" it should work like this
however there is a tricky part,since you send a pigeon it might die on the way,or lose its way so,if you send a pigeon requst it might fail
and will result the code jumping somwhere else and excecuting from there
```java
 send pigeon=`https://www.timeapi.io/api/Time/current/zone?timeZone=NewYork`
```
