a langeuge based on javascript,assembly and c++
you can use it for anything you want,espically if you dont know how to code                                                                                      

first and foremost the variables used in KS
## Declarations
soilder, takes ONLY numbers,no floating numbers are needed in the kings guard soilders cant fly anyway,for example:
```java
 soilder= 20
```
knight,takes a string value,however every string has to start with a sir AS PART OF THE STRING,for example:
```java
knight= "sir hello world"
using "hello world" will return an error since the string does not starts with sir
knight= sir "hello world" will not work either as it isnt part of the string 
```

horse ,takes boolean either hay or nay and have to decalare it with feed,since the horse wont work without food,example:

```java
Feed horse= true
```
 market,a vairable that allows you to hold more then one value,which can be any type of data stored (string,numbers etc) have to be declared with "buy":
```java
buy market=[1,2,sir fatty,dead king,long live the queen]
```
